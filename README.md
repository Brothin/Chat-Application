# Task Title

Team Collaboration and Communication Platform

# Description

Task is to build a team collaboration and communication platform using Node.js. This platform will provide essential features for teams to collaborate effectively, including real-time chat, file sharing, project management, and integration with third-party tools. Here are the key features and requirements:

1. User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user registration and login with secure authentication. Define user roles (e.g., admin, team member) and permissions. Ensure password security and user data protection.

2. Real-time Chat: Create real-time chat rooms or channels for team communication. Support text messaging, emojis, file attachments, and message editing. Implement message notifications and read receipts.

3. File Sharing: Allow users to upload and share files within chat rooms or dedicated file-sharing sections. Implement version control for shared files.

4. Project Management: Provide project management features such as task creation, assignment, and tracking. Implement deadlines, priorities, and progress tracking for tasks.

5. Calendar and Event Scheduling: Include a shared team calendar for scheduling events, meetings, and deadlines. Send reminders and notifications for scheduled events.

6. Integration with Third-party Tools: Allow integration with popular third-party tools and services such as Google Workspace, Trello, or Slack. Implement webhooks or APIs for these integrations.

7. Search and Archiving: Implement a search feature to quickly find past messages, files, and tasks. Archive and organize conversations and files for easy retrieval.

8. Notifications and Alerts: Provide customizable notifications and alerts for different activities and mentions. Allow users to choose notification preferences.

9. Security and Compliance: Ensure the security of user data and messages. Implement data encryption, access controls, and compliance features if needed (e.g., HIPAA compliance).

10. Scalability: Design the platform to handle a growing number of users and teams. Optimize the system for performance and resource utilization.

11. User Experience: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile devices. Ensure a consistent and responsive design.

12. Documentation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for users and administrators on how to use and configure the platform.

13. Testing and Quality Assurance: Implement testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and usability testing.


Implementing a team collaboration and communication platform involves a combination of real-time features, user management, security, and integration with third-party tools. It requires a deep understanding of user experience design and the ability to create a seamless and efficient collaboration environment for teams.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
